# Releases and Versioning

Releases and versioning are closely related concepts in software development. A release represents a specific version of a software product that is made available to users. Versioning, on the other hand, is the practice of assigning unique identifiers (versions) to different states of a software product during its development lifecycle.

### Key Points:

1. **Version Numbers:**
    - Versions are typically represented as a series of numbers separated by dots (e.g., `1.0.0`).
    - These numbers often follow a semantic versioning (SemVer) scheme, consisting of major, minor, and patch versions.

2. **Release Cycle:**
    - A release is a specific instance of making a version of the software available to users.
    - Releases are often associated with new features, bug fixes, and improvements.

3. **Semantic Versioning (SemVer):**
    - Semantic versioning helps convey the nature of changes in a version number.
    - Major versions for backward-incompatible changes, minor versions for backward-compatible new features, and patch versions for backward-compatible bug fixes.

4. **Changelogs:**
    - Changelogs document the changes made in each version.
    - They help users and developers understand what has been added, fixed, or modified in a release.

5. **Version Control Systems:**
    - Version control systems (e.g., Git) play a crucial role in managing versions.
    - Branching and tagging are common practices for marking specific points in the development history.

# Preparing for Google Play Store Release

Preparing your app for release is a multistep process involving the following tasks:

1. **Configure your app for release.**

-At a minimum, you need to make sure that logging is disabled and removed and that your release variant has debuggable false for Groovy or isDebuggable = false for Kotlin script set. You should also set your app's version information.

2. **Build and sign a release version of your app.**

-You can use the Gradle build files with the release build type to build and sign a release version of your app. For more information, see Build and run your app.

3. **Test the release version of your app.**

-Before you distribute your app, you should thoroughly test the release version on at least one target handset device and one target tablet device. Firebase Test Lab is useful for testing across a variety of devices and configurations.

4. **Update app resources for release.**

-Make sure that all app resources, such as multimedia files and graphics, are updated and included with your app or staged on the proper production servers.

5. **Prepare remote servers and services that your app depends on.**

-If your app depends on external servers or services, make sure they are secure and production ready.
