### **Hashing**

Hashing is a fundamental concept in computer science and cryptography. It refers to the process of taking an input (or 'message') and returning a fixed-length string of characters, which is typically a hexadecimal number. This output, known as a hash value or hash code, is generated by a specific algorithm called a hash function.

### **What a Hash Function Does to a Password**

Imagine a password is like a secret code that you use to access your favorite club. Now, a hash function is like a special machine that transforms your secret code (password) into something completely different.

1. **One-way Transformation**: This machine takes your password and turns it into a unique jumble of letters and numbers. Once this transformation happens, you can't easily reverse it to find out the original password. It's a bit like turning a cake back into its individual ingredients â€“ almost impossible!

2. **Fixed Output Length**: The machine always gives you the same length of jumble, no matter how long or short your original password is. It's like your password could be one word or a whole paragraph, but the machine will always give you, say, a 64-character jumble.

3. **Unique Output**: Even a tiny change in your password will result in a completely different jumble. For example, if you change just one letter, the jumble will look totally different.

4. **Consistency**: Every time you enter the same password into this machine, you'll get the same jumble. This way, the club can check if it's really you trying to enter, without knowing your actual password.

So, in simple terms, a hash function takes your password and turns it into a secret code that's unique, fixed in length, and can't be easily turned back into the original password. It helps keep your password safe from prying eyes when it's stored or transmitted online.

### **What does it mean to 'salt' a password?**

To "salt" a password means to add a random or semi-random string of characters (known as a "salt") to the password before hashing it. The purpose of salting passwords is to enhance security by making it much more difficult for attackers to use precomputed tables (rainbow tables) or other common attack methods like dictionary attacks or brute force attacks.

Here's how it works:

1. **User Registration**: When a user creates an account and sets a password, a random salt is generated.

2. **Combining Password and Salt**: The salt is then concatenated (combined) with the user's password.

3. **Hashing**: The combined salted password is then hashed using a secure hash function. The resulting hash is stored in the database along with the salt.

4. **Authentication**: When the user attempts to log in, the system retrieves the salt associated with their account, combines it with the entered password, and hashes it. If the resulting hash matches the stored hash, access is granted.

### **What information does a hacker need to access to find the 'salt' string for your passwords?**

In a properly designed system, the salt should not be kept secret; it's meant to be stored alongside the hashed password in the database. Its purpose is to be unique for each user and to prevent rainbow table attacks, but it doesn't need to be kept confidential.

However, to retrieve the salt string for a specific user's password, a hacker would typically need access to the database where user account information is stored. Gaining unauthorized access to this database is a significant security breach and a serious offense.

Once the attacker has access to the database, they can see the salt associated with each user's password. However, this information alone doesn't immediately allow them to crack the passwords. They would still need to perform a brute force attack or use other techniques to guess the passwords, but the presence of the salt makes this process significantly more challenging and time-consuming.

### **Blowfish Handling Increased Computation Speed:**
Blowfish adapts to faster computers by allowing variable key lengths and using multiple encryption rounds, making it more computationally intensive as needed.

### **Issues with Java Password Hashes:**
1. **jBCrypt (Java Password Hash)**: Limited by a fixed work factor for bcrypt, which may not scale well with faster computers.

2. **Java Password Encryption (e.g., AES)**: Using AES for password storage is discouraged due to deterministic encryption, which can reveal identical passwords, and the complex task of securely managing encryption keys. Dedicated password hashing libraries are recommended for better security.
