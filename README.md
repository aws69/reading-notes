## Introduction to SQL 
**What is SQL Language?**
Structured Query Language, or SQL, is an accepted industry-standard language. It is a query language used to access a database from a language like C/C++, Java, or a web application. SQL is the lingua franca for most database applications. You need a database to store and organize all the information you need to store and organize, such as contacts, addresses, invoices, etc. As of this writing, SQL is the most popular database programming language available.
Using an SQL editor, SQL programmers can access a database to perform queries and get data out of the database. A variety of databases supports SQL. Commonly used databases include Oracle, SQL Server, MySQL, Sybase, and PostgreSQL.
SQL is the industry-standard language for managing databases. It's an easy language to learn and use. In this beginner's tutorial, you'll learn to query, analyze, and create tables, views, indexes, and schemas.
**Why should I learn SQL?**
SQL is the language used to manage and query a database. If you're doing SQL programming for databases like MySQL, Oracle, or SQL Server, it's the language you'll use the most. SQL is the language of the database.

If you're using a database, it's the language you'll use most. SQL is an industry-standard language. Anyone who writes SQL queries knows the language and can share what they know with you. This reduces confusion when you're querying a database.

If you're a Java programmer, learning SQL is like learning a new language. It's easy to pick up if you know to approach the language differently than a native Java developer.
**What we learned in SQL**
- Basic SQL commands
INSERT: used to add new data to a database.
SELECT: used to retrieve data from a database.
DELETE: used to delete data from a database.
UPDATE: used to modify existing data in a database.

- Data types
VARCHAR stores character strings (such as names or addresses).
INTEGER: used to store numerical data.
DATE: used to store date values.

- Operators
AND: used to combine two or more conditions.
OR: used to specify that either of the two conditions can be true.
BETWEEN: used to specify a range of values.

- Creating tables
CREATE TABLE: used to create a new table in a database.

- Modifying tables
ALTER TABLE: used to modify an existing table in a database.

- Querying data
WHERE: used to filter the results of a SELECT statement based on specified conditions.

- Joining tables
INNER JOIN combines rows from two or more tables based on a common column.
LEFT/RIGHT/FULL JOIN: return all the rows from the left table and any rows from the right table that match them.
