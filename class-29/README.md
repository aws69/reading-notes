**Room Database Engine and Suitability:**

Room is an Android library that abstracts SQLite, a lightweight and efficient database engine. SQLite is chosen for its efficiency, reliability, and compatibility with mobile devices, making it suitable for resource-constrained environments.

**Room vs. JPA:**

Room and JPA are both ORM libraries, but Room is optimized for Android development, offering a streamlined approach to SQLite. JPA, a Java specification, is more general-purpose, allowing Java objects to map to database tables.

**DAO in Plain Language:**

A Data Access Object (DAO) is a design pattern that acts as a bridge between application code and databases. It provides a clean interface for database operations, enhancing code modularity and maintainability.
